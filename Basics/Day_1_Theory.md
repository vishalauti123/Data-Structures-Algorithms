# Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA) Definitions

## 1. Data
Data is a collection of raw facts and figures that can be processed to get meaningful information.  
**Example:** Numbers, text, sensor readings, etc.

## 2. Data Structure
A **Data Structure** is a way of organizing, managing, and storing data efficiently so that it can be used effectively.  
It defines the relationship between data elements and operations that can be performed on them.  

**Types of Data Structures:**
- **Linear:** Array, Linked List, Stack, Queue
- **Non-Linear:** Tree, Graph, Heap

## 3. Algorithm
An **Algorithm** is a step-by-step procedure or set of instructions designed to perform a specific task or solve a problem.  
It should have a clear input, output, and finite steps.

**Example:** Algorithm to find the maximum number in an array.

## 4. Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)
**DSA** refers to the study of **data structures** and **algorithms** together to efficiently solve computational problems.  

**Importance of DSA:**
- Helps write optimized code  
- Reduces time and space complexity  
- Essential for competitive programming and technical interviews
